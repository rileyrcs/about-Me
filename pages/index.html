          Hi! My name is Riley Carter Sessions, but you can call me Carter. I am
          16 years old as of November 7th 2019. I am a rising junior at the
          Atlanta Girls School. I have been at AGS since 6th grade so that's
          pretty cool. My favorite food is paella and I love being in the
          kitchen. I am a somewhat skilled baker and cook. My favorite things to
          make are stir fry, eggs of any kind, and I bake a mean lemon pound
          cake. Music is one of my passions. I recently have been listening to a
          lot of Shakey Graves. I like their music because it's rock, indie, and
          a little country. Now I don't particularly like country music, but it
          has itâ€™s time and place. In my opinion the best music is funk. Another
          thing I love is photography. I'm not super good at it, but I really
          enjoy experimenting with my camera. I have a twin sister named Sydney
          and she is pretty cool too. We aren't identical though and most of the
          time people don't even think we are related. We like the same things
          though. We both do theater, but she does more acting and I do behind
          the scenes work. I am actually the assistant director at my school
          which is pretty cool. So Yeah, that's about it!
